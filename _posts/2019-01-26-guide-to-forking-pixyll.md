This is how I’m going about starting my own website developer business. It may not be the most practical or even complete guide out there for getting started in web dev but you stumbled here so check it out. This is also a post to myself as well – past, present and future.

### What does it mean to get started?

To me, this just means you finally wrapped your head around starting a business and realizing this is something you could actually do and also enjoy – web development in our case.

So you have finally decided to take the leap and get yourself out in public. You keep watching everyone else do it and telling yourself that they are better at it than you are. Not sure how that’s even possible since you haven’t really gotten past the first step of actually putting your name out there (talking to myself here). Who knows, this could really lead to something awesome. Now get started and don’t worry about impostor syndrome, pricing for your client’s project, what will you sound like on your first sales pitch, or a face-to-face meeting with someone – WAIT, WHAT!?!

### Stop groaning and start!

Sorry for leaving you hanging, but there will be times when you feel like your the lowest of low on the totem pole in this. I mean, look at those other web developer’s websites and wow, that portfolio that highlights them creating a website for McDonald’s! Say wha’!

With all this information at your fingertips on the dubya-dubya-dubya internet it’s no wonder you’re groaning. I can’t imagine for a moment that the greatest of web developers has already gone through this same moment as you have. “Why can’t I just do the same for less? Now I’m off to learn how to win clients and code a website.” I bet they have but guess what, you are still looking at how awesome their portfolio and business is and still haven’t started anything yet. What are you waiting for, just start!

### Now what do I do?

This is a great question and one that I am in the midst of answering myself. You could go on an all out quest to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript – the main web technologies for creating sites. You could also peruse hundreds of thousands of ux/ui/u&me and portfolio sites that many others have created for inspiration. You could get a certification for a few hundred dollars to say you are now a web developer or attend a few thousand dollar web developer bootcamp to say the same (I have not done these). With all that stuff under your belt you still have not started anything.

The best plan is to start a blog about it, like I’m doing here. It has actually eased my mind into thinking I can do this :-). I know, everyone is saying to blog about your experience and how you started out, but that’s hard to do and think about right now. Just do it. It really does help. And I’m one of those same people that have said, “Whatever, blogging about it won’t make it better or help me start something.”

Now you can just ease into getting your name on the internet, with a website and your new blog. And we arrive at where we’re at now. Congratulations, you have started a website developer’s business! Not exactly, but it’s a “start”!
