My plan is not to upset others in the same space as myself but to educate people in their search for someone like me.

### Why do I see $5 and upwards to $2,500 to build a website?

The $5 website or site maintenance is there for someone to build their portfolio. We (website developers) are always taught, no matter what, to start a portfolio of website work. It’s the same principal when job hunting. The employer will want to see work experience on your resume and if not then you’re apparently going to be an intern – work for free or almost free.

Quite simply, get your name out there, even if it’s just 5 bucks, to enter this market and your golden – not really.

Every person selling their services for beyond $5 is insane. Haha, just joking…or am I. These one man/woman shows or full fledged design studios selling their services for upwards of $2,500 are not crazy but are very very very very good at what they do. Now, you have already seen my price of **$FREE** (as of August 2019) but that doesn’t mean I’m not good and only means I’m trying to get my name out there. I may be able to price my services at $2,500 once my portfolio is built up and you can see all the glorious work done. In another post I’ll go into how I (and most everyone else out there) can build great websites very easily.

“Why would you pay $5 and upwards to $2,500?” can also be answered like so. You (the customer) do not want to learn the technologies or have the time to tinker with a website so you will hire someone that can give you something fast.

So, are $5 and upwards to $2,500 for a website or maintenance a good choice for you? Yes and yes. I bet you can get nearly the same quality for both – if you pick the right person.

### How do I choose the right person based on pricing?

You can’t.

While I may not have a portfolio to boast about, my $5 website can be just as gorgeous or even more gorgeous-er than the $2,500 site.

Why is that, you may ask? Because I am just as proficient with the same technologies that the person/design studio building the $2,500 website is. Yes, their website you found is awesome, with all their pictures in 3D and fancy scrolling and such, but your website usually takes the form of most everyone else out there. “I need a header and footer with links to get something done. A couple sections here displaying what I offer and a contact form.” This describes almost 95% of all websites in the world with those two sentences and this is why I do what I do. Website developers understand this and it is quite easy to get your website built knowing this.

### What else, Mike?

Glad you asked.

I honestly believe that website creation and maintenance has been overpriced for a long time. No one truly has a golden formula for how to offer customers the “best price”. This also makes someone new in this space feel like they can never offer the same overpriced service for cheaper, like I want to do. It will make them look cheap and risk the loss of a potential customer, when in reality they would give the same service – maybe with less fluff than the others. Fluff = mood boards, contracts, screen sharing, videos, etc. Yeah, that stuff is great but building a site and maintenance is easy.

There, I said it. It’s out there. I reread it several times and can’t put it another way. Yes, this last section, especially the part about this being easy, is meant to disrupt the space that I’m in. It’s too easy and fun for me and I can’t agree with others that price should be based on my knowledge of the subject. I know a lot, like a lawyer, and can overcharge for pretty much everything I do concerning website development. I may revisit this post to see if I ever feel different about this subject but it’s highly unlikely that I will.

### What will your prices be?

I had a couple sites before this, but did not blog like this, and the pricing was all over the place. $250/month for website maintenance on one and then *pay what you wish* on the other (for anything).

Now that I’ve seen more and done more research, I think the price point should be…I still don’t know.

I’m thinking about starting at $250 for creating a website. I can probably go even lower and am up for negotiating with my customers. Website maintenance would likely be around $50/month with unlimited requests for changes. Subject to change and as of this post this stuff is still **$FREE**. I just want to help as many people as possible, doing something I love.
