In all my years I would never have imagined using this word but it comes up a lot when referring to freelance workers and website developers. This is what’s supposed to drive our daily work and how those areas, or niches, are going to find us – or we’ll be visible because we’re in that company’s niche that will hire us.

### Define niche

When you see it’s definition, it makes no sense to say “find your niche”, except and until you reach the 2nd and then 6th-ish definition.

> Niche defined (Webster’s)
> 
> **1a:** a recess in a wall especially for a statue
> **b:** something (such as a sheltered or private space) that resembles a recess in a wall
> 
> **2a:** a place, employment, status, or activity for which a person or thing is best fitted “finally found her niche”
> **b:** a habitat supplying the factors necessary for the existence of an organism or species
> **c:** the ecological role of an organism in a community especially in regard to food consumption
> **d:** a specialized market

More research on niche came up with this…

> Encyclopedia
> Some attempts were made to build on the vernacular sense of niche as in “he found his niche,” a measure of how individual human beings attain multidimensional “fit” with their surroundings. But this usage was again criticized as too much of a distortion of the original meaning of niche in biology. The word and related concepts remain common, however, and are widely understood in vernacular usage to describe how individual human beings make their way in the world.

Almost everywhere niche refers to anything but freelancers and website developers and their niche. But I can understand why it’s being used. We need a cool word these days for anything we set out to do or a way to market ourselves. “I’ve found my niche!” or “Hi, what’s your niche?”

### Redefine your “niche”

With the difficult part out of the way, now what do you do? Here, I’ll help. You don’t need to find a niche or particular “market” to expose yourself to. In other words, you are a web developer and you can make any website and help any and everyone you can! There, now all the hype around “find your niche first” can be dispelled, especially in this realm of work.

### I need a niche, right?

Still there, huh. Ok…quite simply, you build websites for people – period. Can you build a website for a lawyer, yes. Can you build a website for a plumber, yes. Can you build a website for your friend, yes. Can you build a website for a fortune 500 company, yes. Then get on with it! You’re already in your “niche”, now go for it.

**You are a website developer!**
