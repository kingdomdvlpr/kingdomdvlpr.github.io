Hi, I’m Mike and I make websites.

Plain and simple, no wild anecdotes, and no fancy programming language to confuse you with or flashy stuff to razzle dazzle you. The flashiness and razzling dazzling will get put on your site ;-).

When you want a website or need help with your existing site then I’ll be here ready to help you out. Give me a shout using the contact form and I’ll get back to you. Thanks!

Wow, I almost forgot to tell you how much everything is. Great news – it’s **$FREE**. Yep, that’s right and no I’m not crazy, promise. This will be the price until I get up and going. All I ask is that you give me a review and permission to share it and what I did to help.
